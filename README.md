# Spacey Bird

This repo holds a clone of the infamous game *Flappy Bird*. It is meant to offer a simple, yet playable version of the game and should serve as learning project.

## Structure

The repo-structure follows the typical web page structure. Basic styles are stored in *spacey-bird.css*, the game logic is implemented in JavaScript in *spacey-bird.js* and the containing HTML is stored in *index.html*.
The resources folder holds images and sounds used for the game. The background image is integrated via css. The JS-files are integrated through the HTML-file. All other resources are integrated through JavaScript.

## Target Audience
This game does not offer anything new to the gaming community. The game should show, that with a few lines of code, you can actually *build* something valuable solely with your computer. The content is targeted to pupils in the age between 12 and 99 with basic programming knowledge.

## Contribution
You are welcome to open pull requests or issues, if they serve the goal to make the code more understandable for the target audience. You can also offer better comments or change the structure, even architectural suggestions are welcome, if they improve the balance between simplicity and playability.
